![SeerAttention Architecture](figures/seer.png)


Official implementation of **SeerAttention** - a novel trainable sparse attention mechanism that learns intrinsic sparsity patterns directly from LLMs through self-distillation at post-training time. Achieves faster inference while maintaining accuracy for long-context prefilling.


## News
- **2025/4/15**: Update batched sparse decoding inference support. 
- **2025/3/12**: Add a small demo on supporting decode sparsity. SeerAttention achieves 60% average decode sparsity without acc loss on AIME! See `eval/reasoning_tasks`. 
- **2025/3/5**: Release AttnGates of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen on HF. Release sparse flash-attn kernel with bwd for fine-tuning.
- **2025/2/23**: Support Qwen! Change the distillation into model adapter so that only AttnGates are saved.
- **2025/2/18**: Deepseek's Native Sparse Attention ([NSA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11089)) and Kimi's Mixture of Block Attention ([MoBA](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoBA)) all aquire similar trainable sparse attention concepts as us for pretrain models. Great works!


## Key Features
**Trainable Sparse Attention** - Outperform static/predefined attention sparsity    
**Block-level Sparsity** - Hardware efficient sparsity at block level  
**Self-Distillation** - Lightweight training of attention gates (original weights frozen)  
**Efficient Kernel** -  Block-sparse FlashAttention implementation  
**Easy Integration** - Works with existing transformer architectures



## Hugging Face Models
The current codebase is improved by only saving the distilled AttnGates' weights. During inference, you can composed the AttnGates and original base model. Check the latest huggingface repos!

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment
```bash
conda create -yn seer python=3.11
conda activate seer
pip install torch==2.4.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . 
```



### 2. Inference with AttnGate Adapter
During inference, we automatically compose your original base model with our distilled AttnGates.

SeerAttention supports two sparse methods (Threshold / TopK) to convert a soft gating score to hard binary attention mask. Currently we simply use a single sparse configuration for all the attention heads. You are encourage to explore other configurations to tradeoff the speedup vs quality.
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoConfig
from seer_attn import SeerAttnLlamaForCausalLM

model_name = "SeerAttention/SeerAttention-Llama-3.1-8B-AttnGates"
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_name)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    config.base_model, 
    padding_side="left",
)

## This will compose the AttnGates and base model
model = SeerAttnLlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    seerattn_sparsity_method='threshold', # Using a threshold based sparse method
    seerattn_threshold = 5e-4, # Higher = sparser, typical range 5e-4 ~ 5e-3
)

# Or using a TopK based sparse method
model = SeerAttnLlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    seerattn_sparsity_method='nz_ratio', 
    seerattn_nz_ratio = 0.5, # Lower = sparser, typical range 0.1 ~ 0.9
)

model = model.cuda()

# Ready to inference
```

### 3. Training your AttnGates
In the current self-distillation training setup, you can train the AttnGates for your own model. Here we give an example script for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. After the distillation process, the AttnGates' weights will be saved.

```bash
## scirpts to reproduce llama-3.1-8b
bash run_distillation.sh
```


## Kernel Library in SeerAttention


### 1. Inference Kernel 
We have a triton version and a CUDA version of 2D block-sparse flash-attn kernel for current SeerAttention inference. By default, the triton kernel is used as backend. The CUDA kernel is still being improved. See `seer_attn/block_sparse_attention` for more details.


### 2. Kernel to generate 2D maxpooled ground truth for self-distillation training
If first compute the intermediate attn-map (softmax(Q*K)) and then perform 2D maxpooled to generate the ground truth, it will cost huge GPU memory due to the quadratic size of the attn-map. Thus, we implement a kernel to directly generate the 2D maxpooled attn-map for efficient self-distillation training process. 


```python
### simple pseudo codo for self-distillation AttnGate training
from seer_attn.kernels.attn_pooling_kernel import attn_with_pooling

predict_mask = attn_gate(...)

attn_output, mask_ground_truth = attn_with_pooling(
    query_states,
    key_states,
    value_states,
    is_causal, 
    sm_scale,
    block_size      
)

###...
loss = self.loss_func(predict_mask, mask_ground_truth)   
```

### 3. Fine-tuning kernels (beta)
We release multiple kernels for sparse-atttention-aware fine-tuning. See `seen_attn/kernel/varlen` for details.

- Compress the sequence dimention for both Q, K and V. Similar to current SeerAttention Prefill.

```python

k = repeat_kv_varlen(k, self.num_key_value_groups)
v = repeat_kv_varlen(v, self.num_key_value_groups)
attn_output = block_2D_sparse_attn_varlen_func(
    q, # [t, num_heads, head_dim]
    k, # [t, num_heads, head_dim]
    v, # [t, num_heads, head_dim]
    cu_seqlens, 
    cu_seqlens,
    max_seqlen,
    1.0 / math.sqrt(self.head_dim),
    block_mask, # [bsz, num_heads, ceil(t/block_size), ceil(t/block_size)]
    block_size, # block_size of sparsity           
)
```
- Compress only the sequence dimention of KV while enforcing all the heads within a GQA group share the same sparse mask. This is similar to the find-grained sparse branch of deepseek NSA. 

```python

attn_output = block_1d_gqa_sparse_attn_varlen_func(
    q,  # [t, num_q_heads, head_dim]
    k,  # [t, num_kv_heads, head_dim]
    v,  # [t, num_kv_heads, head_dim]
    cu_seqlens, 
    cu_seqlens,
    max_seqlen,
    1.0 / math.sqrt(self.head_dim),
    block_mask, # [bsz, num_kv_heads, t, ceil(t/block_size)]
    block_size, # block_size of sparsity             
)

```
The code for fine-tuning with SeerAttention will be release soon.  


## Evaluation
For efficiency, we evaluate `block_sparse_attn` compared with full attention by FlashAttention-2. 

![SeerAttention Kernel Efficiency](figures/efficiency.png)


For model accuracy, we evaluate SeerAttention on PG19, Ruler and LongBench. Please refer to `eval` folder for details.
