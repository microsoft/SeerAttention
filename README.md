![SeerAttention Architecture](figures/seerattention-r.png)


Official implementation of **SeerAttention** and **SeerAttention-R** - a novel trainable sparse attention mechanism that learns intrinsic sparsity patterns directly from LLMs through self-distillation at post-training time. Achieves faster inference while maintaining accuracy for long-context prefill and decoding (long-reasoning).

## Key Features
**Trainable Sparse Attention** - Outperform static/predefined attention sparsity    
**Block-level Sparsity** - Hardware efficient sparsity at block level  
**Self-Distillation** - Lightweight training of attention gates (original weights frozen)  
**Efficient Kernel** -  Block-sparse FlashAttention implementation  
**Easy Integration** - Works with existing transformer architectures


## News
- **2025/6/10**: Release SeerAttention-R: training and inference code of decoding sparsity for long-reasoning models. See `eval/reasoning_tasks` for reasoning tasks evaluation.
- **2025/2/23**: Support Qwen. Change the distillation into model adapter so that only AttnGates are saved.
- **2025/2/18**: Deepseek's Native Sparse Attention ([NSA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11089)) and Kimi's Mixture of Block Attention ([MoBA](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoBA)) all aquire similar trainable sparse attention concepts as us for pretrain models. Great works!
- **2025/10/8** Init of SeerAttention Repo.

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment
```bash
conda create -yn seer python=3.11
conda activate seer
pip install torch==2.4.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
pip install -e . 
```



### 2. Inference with AttnGate Adapter
During inference, we automatically compose your original base model with our distilled AttnGates.

SeerAttention supports two sparse methods (Threshold / TopK) to convert a soft gating score to hard binary attention mask. Currently we simply use a single sparse configuration for all the attention heads. You are encourage to explore other configurations to tradeoff the speedup vs quality.
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoConfig
from seer_attn import SeerAttnLlamaForCausalLM ## Sparse Prefill Modeling
from seer_attn import SeerDecodingQwen3ForCausalLM ##  Sparse Decoding Modeling
import torch

## SeerAttention-R: sparse decoding 
model_name = "SeerAttention/SeerAttention-Decode-Qwen3-4B-AttnGates"
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    config.base_model, 
    padding_side="left",
)
## Token budget based sparsity selection. You can also use threshold method
model = SeerDecodingQwen3ForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    seerattn_sparsity_method='token_budget', 
    seerattn_token_budget = 4096, 
).cuda()


## SeerAttention: sparse prefill 
model_name = "SeerAttention/SeerAttention-Llama-3.1-8B-AttnGates"
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    config.base_model, 
    padding_side="left",
)
## Threshold based sparsity selection. You can also use Top-k method
model = SeerAttnLlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    seerattn_sparsity_method='threshold', # Using a threshold based sparse method, 
    seerattn_threshold = 5e-4, # Higher = sparser, typical range 5e-4 ~ 5e-3
).cuda()


# Ready to inference
```

### 3. Training your AttnGates
In the current self-distillation training setup, you can train the AttnGates for your own model. Here we give an example script for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. After the distillation process, the AttnGates' weights will be saved.

```bash
## Run the script to train SeerAttention-R Qwen3-4B decoding gate
## Replace BASE_MODEL to the pretrain model you want to train. 
## Currently only support Qwen2 and Qwen3 architecture. 
## You might need to change the default to chat_template to keep the tokens between <think> </think>. See `chat_template` for examples. 
BASE_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-4B bash run_distillation_decode.sh


## Run the script to train llama-3.1-8b prefill gate
BASE_MODEL=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct bash run_distillation_prefill.sh

```
